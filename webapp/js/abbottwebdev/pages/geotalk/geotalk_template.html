    <h3>How To Use</h3>
 <p class="lead">
     The GPS accuracy is typically 5m radius at it's best.  Some messages may appear to jump as your location is calibrated or may seem out of place because of the variance in accuracy.
     To enter a new message go to the second tab type your message in the box at the top and press "Send".  There are three different ways to view messages around you.  The first is to use the augmented reality view on the first tab to view the messages around you in their locations relative to you.  You may click on the message to get a more stable look at the message in an alert box.  On the second tab you can see a list of messages close to you, sorted by distance.  On the third tab is a Google Maps view with markers in the geographic locations.  Click on the markers to view the messages.
